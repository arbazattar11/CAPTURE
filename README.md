# CAPTURE Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline is designed to analyze CAPTURE sequencing data. Below are the steps involved:

1. **Quality Control (QC):**
   - FASTQ files are checked for quality using FastQC, and a summary report is generated using MultiQC.

2. **Read Alignment:**
   - Reads are aligned to the reference genome using BWA.

3. **Peak Calling (Optional):**
   - CAPTURE does not typically involve peak calling as in ChIP-seq analysis.

4. **Quality Control of Reads:**
   - MultiQC generates a report to assess the quality of sequencing reads.

5. **Annotation and Visualization:**
   - Identified enriched regions from CAPTURE are annotated with genomic features using annotateRegions.pl, and a profile plot is generated.

6. **Differential Binding Analysis (Optional):**
   - Differential binding analysis is not typically performed in CAPTURE analysis.

7. **Functional Enrichment Analysis:**
   - Perform functional enrichment analysis of captured regions using external tools like GREAT or Enrichr.

8. **Interaction Calling (Optional):**
   - Interaction calling is not typically performed in CAPTURE analysis.

9. **Visualization and Interpretation:**
   - Visualize and interpret the identified enriched regions to gain insights into protein-DNA interactions.

## Usage
- Clone this repository.
- Place your FASTQ files in the same directory as the pipeline script.
- Modify the script as necessary to specify paths and parameters.
- Run the pipeline using `./pipeline.sh`.

## Requirements
- BWA
- FastQC
- MultiQC
- deeptools (for annotateRegions.pl and plotProfile)
- External tools for functional enrichment analysis

## Notes
- Adjust parameters and additional analysis steps based on specific experimental needs.
- Ensure reference genome files are available and properly indexed.
