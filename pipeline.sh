# Step 1: Quality Control
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam

# Step 3: Peak Calling (Optional)
# Not applicable for CAPTURE, as it does not involve ChIP-seq peaks

# Step 4: Quality Control of Reads
multiqc qc_reports/

# Step 5: Annotation and Visualization
# Analyze the enriched regions identified by CAPTURE
annotateRegions.pl captured_regions.bed hg38 > annotated_regions.txt
plotProfile -m aligned_reads.bam -out profile.pdf

# Step 6: Differential Binding Analysis (Optional)
# Not typically performed in CAPTURE analysis

# Step 7: Functional Enrichment Analysis
# Perform functional enrichment analysis of captured regions using external tools

# Step 8: Interaction Calling (Optional)
# Not typically performed in CAPTURE analysis

# Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the identified enriched regions
